Downtown is fine if you are a business traveler .Rate are cheap , but breakfast was not included and hotel $ 20 for breakfast buffet .I bit too much for the and the quality is mediocre at best .are spacious , but .Hotel could do with a refurbishment .Pool was dirty .Overall , it was for the money and acceptable while on a business trip , but if I stayed in the hotel for , it would be very disappointing . I stayed here for one night for a short business trip with in downtown .This was part of the Luxury Collection , but been many times before , I did not expect much .Turns out I was way wrong .This was probably one of the best I have stayed in the last year .The hotel is about 40 from airport in downtown .Check in staff was extremely courteous and actually me to the ( instead of saying \" turn left , then right ...\" as the front often does ).The front area is not huge , but a open seating and meeting place .The room was spacious enough , with a big glass wall on the outside , a 42 \" flat screen , and terrific lighting that you to adjust the brightness in various of the room .The bed was very comfy .Everything was clean and well .The bath and toilet were divided into two separate , and the sink area was separate .This can be useful for in the room .There was a complimentary bottle of water , and were top notch .There was a nice collection of in a rack next to the toilet bowl !cost the usual $ 12 to $ 14 a day .Just one downside .The area around the hotel \\' t exactly swanky .There are a lot of office , but the place really to die down after 5 .There is a and a decent restaurant next door , but there \\' s also a up building . Our aim was to get away for a few days , do some shopping and have a few good .The hotel was very well positioned to do that being central to all the major downtown and Pike Market .The hotel restaurant was no great but it is walking distance to some great .Would certainly return . The Primrose is a good hotel for people who plan on just a few in and plan on only sleeping there .I stayed there for one night with three .It was in a good location on / College Ave .It was only a few east of St .The hotel parking was a little expensive ( CAN $ 15 ) and the garage is compact so I would be careful if you drive a big car or .The room are clean .The bathroom a little work but it was good enough for my needs .The non - free continental breakfast is a joke .I would just find breakfast somewhere else .In all , I would stay there again if I plan on going to to have fun . I stayed at the in mid - June for one night on a business trip .It is adjacent to the mall , and across the street from the city hall .This it an ideal location for , but a bit far if you have in the main business district in the downtown core ( although it \\' s not too bad for that ).I hesitate to start with a description of a not - so - good experience , but the staff response to the not - so - good experience was handled so well that in the end , I left the hotel quite .The issue I had is that the phone system in some of the was not when I checked in .The front desk clerk told me about it , and said the hotel would pay for a calling card for me if I wished to make .I thought that was , so I accepted the room and settled in .I tried to hook up my computer to the in the room afterwards , but I found that this was not working either because of the phone line issue .I the customer service person ( with my cell phone !)and said that I really to do some work on my computer and I whether they could not speed up the repair on the line .The customer service person was quite apologetic and told me that she would see what she could do .A few later this person came to my room and handed me a key to another room that to have its line fixed already for that night .I , and everything was then .I thought that the service response was great - I have never had someone come to my room to hand me another key .The room itself was up to \\' s usual - well done , not over - the - top luxurious , but very nice .The bed was comfortable and I got a good night \\' s sleep .I recommend this hotel , especially if you want to do a bit of shopping . We a quick , one - night visit to , and stayed at the Island Hotel .To get there , we took the quick little ferry from downtown , and with our rolling to the hotel , conveniently and yet away from any traffic .It \\' s a calm , well - designed \" \" hotel just past the end of the road on Island .Check - in was friendly and efficient , and our room , although small , was fine .Even though we had the basic \" non - view \" category , our little balcony had a view of the water across to downtown , and a bonus was the over Science World ( after all , it was ).My only are small .The public are nicely decorated , but our room had a couple of sad \" department store \" on the - and considering Island is a hub of artistic activity , I would have to see better art ( why not link with the Carr school of art across the street , and promote local ?).A tiny problem , but big when you are in a hurry : offer better hair than the low - powered one provided .And the most annoying : the room lighting is poor , in particular the reading light .There actually \\' t any ; the bedside lamp is too dim to read by .My husband tried removing the shade from the lamp , which only a tiny bit .On mornings , it \\' s great to get the newspaper to the door , but until the sun came up we had trouble reading it .Those small aside , this is a lovely hotel in a great area , close to the of yet far enough away to provide solace .We hope to be back soon . At first i thought this was the perfect Hotel for our first trip to .The location is great , the hotel itself is fairly new so everything was clean and nicely .But then it was all down hill from there .First , there was absolutely no / maid service !We were there for 4 days / 3 nights and every day we had to track down a maid to request clean .We to have a maid clean our bathroom and take the trash out , no one ever came !Second , after 11pm you have to use your room card to get into the building .After your card then you are by someone about which room you are going to .One night , while we were coming back into the hotel , we had one guest come up to our room to visit us .... but we were informed that our guest had 10 !!!!and that after 10 they were going to come up into our room to check if our guest was still there ??!!Our guest was not spending the night only visiting us !!Third , when it was time to check out there was no bell boy to help with our .We were informed that we can get the cart and use it ourselves .Fourth , when we gave the valet our ticket stub he came back with the wrong car !It is not that hard to match up on to find a vehicle .How easy could it have been for someone else to leave with our truck if they could bring us the wrong car ?Fifth , we were told there was 24 hour room service , when we about room service we were told the kitchen was closed !Sixth , we were told over the phone that we could get a roll out bed ( cot ) for free , when we we were informed that to add a roll out bed would be a fire hazard . This was our 5th visit to and our first budget trip and i have to say that this little gem of a hotel is far superior to other more expensive in the area .The location is a little out the way for Universal , Prime ( formerly ), I Drive but it \\' s only 5 from , you can see the top of Expedition from the car park at the back !!All the staff were extremely helpful , friendly and approachable .We were to a room without even and our check out was extended to 1pm without any .Our room had a brand new air unit which was than the we are used to , a microwave , , freezer , , safe and .The had premium ( perfect for after a hectic day at the ).The bed was clean and comfortable and the maid came 6 times a week .The pool was a good size , very clean and out onto the lake .Yes there were some little black but if you got a lounger away from the hedge they \\' t bother you and there certainly \\' t any in our room .There are a to eat along the 192 , is great for it \\' s huge buffet breakfast and filling up before a day at the .I would highly recommend a trip to the in Downtown , in Universal , on I drive and at the they are all brilliant !!If you \\' re looking for a quiet night in is less than a mile up the road where you can stock up on ice cream , , beer & wine .Without a doubt I \\' d return to this hotel , it \\' s superb value for money .You hardly spend any time in your room anyway and it leaves you with more spending money for the and . The Settle Inn was very friendly .The suite was big enough for the to have space to play and not be on top of us .Their favorite part was the breakfast show , the entertainer included them at intermission and they went home and told everyone they were IN the show !The extended pool are great , you can swim before you start your day and after you return from .The washer and were ann added plus , especially when traveling with 4 .The microwave and came in very handy for the special .The were comfy and the were soft , which is hard to find in some .We will go back again . We booked a three - night stay at the last week after we had to check out of our original hotel unexpectedly .I read the wonderful on and was able to get a room in the main house for a very reasonable price .From the moment we stepped inside the heavenly air - of the lobby , our in all were .Caroline at the front desk was friendly and welcoming , and gave us a free glass of wine after we checked in .Our room on the third floor was sparkling clean , cool , and well - , with window under the and a view out over St .The room was kept clean and neat and the turndown service each night was great .Everyone at the front desk was incredibly friendly and helpful throughout our stay .One of the best about the is the beautiful hidden courtyard with two .The garden is beautifully and there are , lounge , and free water and iced tea ( and , in the morning , coffee ) for .We spent one long afternoon lounging there and it was wonderfully !Overall , I ‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢ t think of a single thing I would change about our stay .The was a lucky find for us , and ‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢ absolutely recommend it to everyone ! While our trip to , I was by how expensive most of the \" nice \" were , even in low season ( we went first week of ).This hotel me to book with it with its relatively lower price , nice , and good .It turns out that the hotel IS pretty great .The front - desk staff was pleasant and helpful ( we had to store our luggage with them for a day after out and there were no ), the lobby was gorgeous , the breakfast was top notch ( and free !), and our room was perfect , with silky smooth , a clean bathroom , and ample space .The only problem is when you step outside to use the pool and - the swim - up bar is cute and the hamburger fare there is good ( albeit a bit too salty ), but every ten it like an airplane was about to crash - land on your head .I could not believe how noisy it was , and I \\' lived near airport all my life .It was literally like the were landing next door ( and I guess they sort of were ).Fortunately , the hotel itself is well insulated , so the noise \\' t affect you at all when you \\' re inside .If it \\' t for the noisy pool , the hotel would be an easy A + ( and probably cost a lot more ).As it is , I give it an A -. Overall , I was very with this hotel .We stayed in a few in this area , and this one was the best given the price .Location : Just a block or so away from Termini station .No cab .Less than a few walk away .We were able to walk to every other point of interest ( Colosseum10 away , Fountain was 15 away , .)except for City , which was a short ride away .We did take to certain for dinner just because we \\' t feel as comfortable walking around at night .If you don \\' t want to venture out at night , plenty of decent restaurant nearby ( and La are a couple ) Room : We got a classic double room .King sized bed , VERY nice bathroom with the usual .Water pressure great .. were big .were not the most plush I \\' slept in , but so much better than a lot of other hotel you \\' encounter .Nice bedding and .Mattress on the firm side .in the room is available , but at a charge .I believe 22 a day .Breakfast : Probably the best I had in the few we stayed at .Really nice dining area , friendly staff and great + the usual fare : , , , , , fruit , . In we returned to the Hotel for a four day stay .Our previous stay at the - just prior to them being a rating as a place to stay by - was tremendous .Unfortunately the hotel to have lost its star status - or at least that was our experience .The lobby and the room were needing some care and attention .Obviously the hotel this as the major problem we experienced was due to renovation .Construction and painting were going on in the room next to ours .A strong smell of paint in our room throughout our four day stay - even over a weekend .When a complaint was made after the first night the staff sent up a machine intended to clean the air , we were told not to be in the room while it was on .We to keep the window open when we were in the room resulting in a cold stay .was not warm in .We were not provided with an option of moving - despite this being a four day stay .In addition there was noise throughout the day so a little nap in the afternoon during the holiday was out of the question .should be advised that construction is taking place prior to booking .The of the have risen over the as the hotel been discovered .Our experience in 2006 does not support the reputation that the hotel now .Perhaps the will help to keep the hotel at the top but in the should be informed that the construction may impact on their comfort and enjoyment . Just returned from three nights in .The hotel was so good I had to share it .Beautiful clean .The staff were really friendly and helpful with all our .The local area is fabulous with great food and just away .Would definitely visit again . When to after a side trip to , we chose the Hotel for three : its proximity to the to the airport , the good price , and our desire to explore a different part of : up - and - coming .Based on , we had the reception and to be put in a quiet room that had already their soundproofing renovation .The hotel did indeed put us into a quiet room ; we could hear neither our nor too much of the traffic outside .So ask for a soundproof - room when making your reservation .Our room was very bright and had an interesting color scheme , but a bit of wear and tear .We the slightly floor in this old building , but considered it an interesting feature .was fascinating to explore , and it was hard to pick a restaurant given all the great . We recently had to spend a night in because of an early flight out of .We found that it was in downtown at a quality hotel than by the airport .Because the new Canada Line from downtown to the airport in less than 30 for only $ 2 . 50 after 6 and , it \\' s actually easier than waiting for airport hotel .We $ 70 a night on for the Renaissance and was pleasantly by the experience .We were there during the last weekend of the and yet check - in was quick and the room assigned was roomy and comfortable .Unfortunately , I am a light sleeper and the first room was on a floor with noisy young people running between .However , we quickly got another room without any argument and were told that if we were not happy with it , they would find us a room that would make us happy .It turns out that the second room was behind the elevator shaft so ..... we were cheerfully given a third room .Luckily , the third room was quiet and comfortable .Five for the front - desk \\' s cheerful and \" make - right \" attitude .Other so - 4 star should learn from this attitude . I visit beautiful any chance I get and I have been in many in this city .My top of line is Sandman on because of its great location and price value .The hotel is part of chain which are 3 but I think this hotel is 3 . 5 or 4 .If you are in for vacation you have to go to Bay , Park , street and entire west end neighborhood .This hotel a perfect location to all these great and more .You can walk to any and any time ( downtown is very safe and busy even after mid night ).The only thing that it may bother some crowd would be the fact that this hotel is on a friendly Gay neighborhood !I am not gay so if it did not bother me at all why should u be battered ?!oh one more great thing is street is full of good .You can try any for good price .From , , to ........ I was afraid to stay in this hotel after reading the other , but it was most conveniently to the company I was visiting so I \\' t switch .I was pleasantly to find a newly room .The bed had a pillow - top , fitted that stayed put during the night , and comfortable .The bathroom was quite nice , with marble , a full sized hair , and several small to keep my .The one strange thing was the lack of a bathroom door , but the front desk assured me that this is temporary and due to the recent ( the were in being ), and only single are given without a bathroom door .I had a problem with my thermostat the first night and it was fixed quickly .I only ate breakfast in the restaurant , and found it adequate . Do yourself a favor and do not stay at this hotel .With so many as , you do not need to subject yourself to our experience .On our last night at the hotel ( we stayed 10 nights ) we were our when I discovered that my jewelry had been stolen from our suitcase .There are no hotel , nor are there in the .In my naivete , I assumed there would be a safe so I did not check when we confirmed our booking .Without a safe , we decided to do the next best thing and hide our jewelry in one suitcase that was rolled up and put into another , which was then stuffed under the armoire !The thief , apparently a professional , was so adept at the real from the fake , that only costume jewelry .Overall , close to $ 12 , 000 in jewelry was stolen .We the police , and they an \" investigation \".Clearly , the jewelry would never be found .The hotel manager and owner , . , was not helpful , and washed his clean of this unfortunate event .With so few in the hotel ( there are a total of 6 the owner ) it is quite disappointing to have experienced such a tragedy . We stayed at the Grand for a combination of business and leisure travel .My husband was traveling for business ( making the cost of the hotel less of an issue ), while I went sight - seeing .We were generally very happy with the Grand .The room was adequate in size , and nicely .The bed was very comfortable .The are well , with nice and a good shower .I did wish for a double - sink , but those seem to be less common outside the U . S . ( I \\' m not sure who thought up the rectangular toilet seat - very cute , but \\' t fit the round shape of the object sitting on it ).We ate at the restaurant and found it very good , if .We also used the gym - it only three of equipment and one weight machine , but they were all in good condition .We used the pool and sauna - nice after a day of touring .The hotel is very well .We don \\' t mind a little walking and only used a cab to take us to the train station when we left .There of lots of , , and very nearby , and the Frank House and Van Museum are an easy 20 minute walk .One note if you are traveling soon - ask about the ongoing construction or plan to be up by 8 : 00 a . m . sharp - the pounding on the building is . I stayed at for 5 nights in June a family of 2 and 2 in one room .While the room was small it was clean and the bathroom recently .The location was great next to and station .It is close to many , and .There was of Police and transit police security at night , they park their at the rear of the hotel .Our family felt safe and we have no concern the hotel .To me the are expensive , however the whole family in one room is the best way to . The Hotel is situated in perfect location to take advantage of \\' s beautiful .We were able to walk to just about every historic site and museum within 20 .There are boundless \\' s and \\' s within of the hotel .A main bus line is a two block walk .The plaza , with a fabulous fountain is a 1 - 2 minute walk from the hotel where you can find numerous , \\' s , and beautiful and evening entertainment .The plaza is 4 - 5 minute walk with a market that is .The Pantheon is just a 3 - 4 minute walk from the hotel where more \\' s , and entertainment await .My wife and I had never been to , but we have traveled extensively over the .We enjoy that we can meet people and learn a bit more of the culture and history of we visit .The owner of the , and his were GREAT at providing us and within .I love the fact that I saw the owner at the hotel every day talking with , staff and and doing all he could to make his feel a part of the city and the Hotel .We stayed at the for 6 nights and we would stay there again .I feel that the price , , location and assistance provided by the hotel staff met and our .WE LOVE ! Just returned from a 4 night stay .Overall a very nice hotel in an upscale location .It \\' s at the top of via which is lined with upscale and .Easy walk to stop and across the street from a bus stop .Double room was spacious and clean .were marble and clean .Breakfast had a very good variety of food .Staff were helpful .\\' t have a chance to check out the fitness facility .Only a couple ... desk chair was wobbly and nearly broken .\\' t work in my original room . It was our first time in Key West with my family and as soon as I get to the hotel it was terrible .The bathroom smelled like sewer water , the front door \\' t open , it felt like we were in a motel .Why would make this kind of hotel but it really is not a hotel it \\' s a motel .I don \\' t this hotel ( motel ). My husband and I just stayed at the Grand Hotel this past weekend for and also to celebrate his birthday .We stay here often , several times a year , and once again had a fabulous experience .The hotel is so conveniently , are spacious and clean with fabulous of the beach , great lobby area and coffee shop .The hotel staff is extremely friendly from the moment you call to make a reservation , during your stay , until the time you check out .The entire staff is always great to deal with , however , during this particular visit , Fay at the front desk went above and beyond to make our stay extra special .She was extremely friendly and accommodating .It was so nice to meet someone who really their job and does it well !!!When we checked out , Fay had a birthday card from the hotel and a piece of cake for my husband .Her kindness and thoughtfulness for the type of service you \\' receive .The Grand is fortunate to have an employee as fantastic as she !You will enjoy here - and if you \\' re lucky , Fay will greet you when you arrive . We stayed at Saint for 3 nights .We got in very late , ( 12 am ), the first night & were by two very nice & helpful staff .Anything we the staff would immediately accommodate us & they also had great on where to go for entertainment , .The food in the restaurant was incredible , the chocolate was most delectable and the waiter , , never rushed us , even after the restaurant was closed ; although , the de was not so friendly , he was actually very rude both times we tried to dine there .The were so comfortable with a goose down comforter and big bathroom .My room had a balcony & living room which was great since we were traveling with ; when they came over we could \" entertain \" in our suite .I the location because we were a step a way from everything ... we did so much walking .The jazz festival was 5 north , the port was one block south and touristy stuff was a few away .I had a great time & would definitely stay there again . We this hotel a few back , and because of the location and value for money , we decided to come back .Our impression is really the same like the first time .The location is fantastic , the value and the reasonable quality it hard to beat .The hotel felt a bit more worn than the first time we stayed here , that not too much money is spent on refurbishment .I doubt that we \\' be back for a third time .Nevertheless , I you want to stay in center of Barcelona without paying , we can recommend this hotel . Just back from the Hotel , Barcelona .Took a little time to actually find the hotel but when we did we were met with a friendly and efficient check in .Had a great room on the 6th floor - all our were met - we had direct with the hotel that we had a room on the top floor , non smoking , away from the elevator and a bath and shower - oh and a king size bed .Slight road noise at night but that is the only negative .Fabulous breakfast spread - chocolate - a first I must say - and delicious too .The breakfast room is lovely and bright and again great serving staff .Also found a fantastic restaurant around the corner - I think .Ate there 3 times in 4 days - greedy or what .Staff again were great and food and ambience very nice . We a two night break ( primarily to watch the !)and thoroughly our stay .The room was delightful and the staff \\' t really do enough for us .My wife \\' t well during our stay so we had room service for breakfast - superb .The \" Grill \" restaurant does need to improve it \\' s menu - the hotel from a top of the range restaurant ( very dear ) and the \" Grill \" restaurant which only really basic .The hotel could do with a mid - range restaurant serving , steak to be a complete package .The walk through the park to the is lovely ( though not advised at night ) - taxi \\' s to and from are not too dear however .We being a little way from the hustle of the city .Overall a really beautiful hotel - . Great hotel , Great staff !restaurant next door wonderful as well !Good location , walking distance to everything we to see ( , market , waterfront , grey line bus tour ) .Will be our \" go to \" hotel in from now on .Thanks Vintage Park from your in !! Usually would stay at hotel , but it expensive on the ( see my review on ), so ended up here for the first time , because of and price .It was a good hotel for the price point ......Here is the good ...... 1 .Great location on Rue , near University 2 .hotel , so nice and clean , not too many and scratches 3 .Very good work out and pool facility , 3 elliptical , 3 , up to 50 , free with bench , pool and , there is a steam room in locker room .You will need your room key to access this area 4 .are large , nothing special .Pretty much like hotel room .My room only had a shower ( no tub ) 5 .6 . free bottle of water in room 7 .Free that excellent 8 .Friendly staff 9 .Good check in and check out 10 .You hear just a bit of noise from the street , but pretty well sound proof .I didnt hear noise from neighboring 11 .Need room key to access in elevator .Good security measure 12 .Price point was great for what you get The not so good .....Nothing was bad at this hotel .... Just some to keep in mind 1 .This is a hotel / apartment complex , so you have to keep straight the elevator .They are well marked if you happen across the apartment 2 .have a pretty obnoxious / buzz .when you push of .Also you need your room key to access .This is good for security but bad for ease of use My partner and I stayed here for three nights in at the recommendation of a good friend who the city .We had a fabulous time in and a fabulous stay at The Place .champagne , cheese plate and chocolate covered as soon as we the room ( - by ).Bed was so comfortable we were the mattress tag to shop when we got home .Super ( from room 1808 ).Absolutely no noise .Perfect location .Great selection of all around and a reasonable walk to of shopping along Magnificent Mile ( if that \\' s your thing ).Also , access to the Red Line train is a five - minute walk from the hotel .We took it to as well as a nearby stop for Crate and and CB2 . I just came back from after spending 4 nights in Cicerone .I would say this hotel maybe 3 and a half or almost 4 .Location is just excellent - walking distance to , , , Campo do , , di , Pantheon .I and every day and it was really comfortable to stay in Cicerone to reach all those in a very short time .Breakfast was rather average then good although the buffet was full of .My room was on the 8th floor ( attic ) so the lift goes to 7th floor only and then , what was no problem at all for me - I could walk even more for this low price which was half price then - special price .in the attic were rather small , but comfortable enough , bathroom was also O . K .besides the shower tube was not working good .There where rather small in the top part of the room , but it was not important to me to have big as I spent each day outside of the room .Generally good hotel with some negative . We chose Hotel because of the good on Trip Advisor and it to be centrally .We were not disappointed !Service was excellent both before and our stay .The concierge us ( via ) with some fantastic restaurant and other of before we left home .On arrival , the great service continued ... nothing was too much bother for them .They restaurant , gave us advice and and a sunset cruise on the Grand Canal ( we were to take along a bottle of !)The hotel is only a few \\' walk from Piazza San Marco and on the same canal as the Bridge of .We for a Deluxe Room with a canal view which was lovely .The room ( number 405 ) was tiny but perfectly formed .You had to be a bit on the neat side as there \\' t much space , but it was clean , the bed was firm and comfy and it had great .Best of all , it had its own little roof - top deck with over the whole of .We a few up there !Our room rate included breakfast ... fairly standard fare but nicely and great service too .I would definitely go back to Hotel .... and ask for the same room :-) We and hotel from .room at in the .Hotel closed for so we were booked at the in city center instead .Thank you .within walking distance of Dam Square , Square , , , shopping and .The furniture is but that is . Breakfast buffet is but there are plenty of .Staff spoke well and they were very helpful .Overall , I was very with the hotel and would recommend for anyone on a modest budget .You will not be disappointed . I stayed at the Hotel in this year with a girl friend , I agree with the previous review , the address given on the we booked through [--] was and we ended up getting of the water bus at bridge , walking over the bridge ( with 13 pound ) only to find it was on the other side !!And it was HOT .For reference , Ca d \\' is closer .We stayed in a twin bedroom on the second floor ( 265 if memory ), it was small but well with plenty of storage space .There is free air - con in the room which was nice on an evening .Bridge only 2 away and St Square in walking distance , the receptionist said it was a 20 min walk but we found a short cut of only 8 or so ( although I can \\' t remember it now !).The staff were very courteous and helpful , the latest we got back was 1am and there was a night receptionist for entry and .Breakfast was a typical Continental affair but plentiful .Afternoon tea ( by the decorative pool from 2 - 5 ) was a lovely touch and just what we after a hot day of .The location was great , I \\' m glad we \\' t stay in St Square as it was way and we more of the city .We went for a wedding ( which was beautiful ), if you are going for the same reason the Town Hall is just by Bridge and to the left .Would stay there again . This was our first trip to Barcelona and the last leg of our trip .My husband and I \\' t have a large budget so we to stay outside of the main tourist area in order to get a better rate for our 4 night stay .This hotel is what I would say on the edge of the tourist area but still definitely in walking distance to all of the .It is about a 10 min walk to the main and about a 15 - 20 min walk down to Las , .We even down to the beach , which \\' t bad at all !But we like to travel by foot to take in the culture .:) To get here we took the train and and it was very very easy and inexpensive .To leave we for the taxi service because our flight was at 6am .Both great for to and from the airport .The front desk is very helpful and there 24 / 7 .The and lobby are very clean and modernly .The are very quiet , which is great for long days of being out and about .The hotel is very safe and there were absolutely no of theft .Our room itself was HUGE - king bed , couch , desk , big dressing area , huge bathroom .It was great for the last part of our trip !I would definitely recommend this hotel if you are look for a dependable less expensive place to stay . We stayed here in reliance on TA , which have been quite accurate in the past all over the world .Prepared for a charming , homey place , we immediately knew we had chosen badly when we saw exterior and lobby .Tacky and shabby .Maybe for a business traveler on a budget .Breakfast was dismal , with cereal and some yoghurt .Bad location for anything but business .Manager was very nice and quite helpful .was free and worked well . This small hotel is down a quiet city street and is convenient , affordable , and clean .As with most , we spent the majority of our time outside of the hotel .However , we did make great use of our private terrace for a little happy hour before to the City for the evening . My wife and I spent six nights at the Ca \\' in , 2010 .Our stay , in a word , was fantastic .We stayed in a junior suite which had plenty of space and my wife the bathroom .The art were a really nice change from the usual surroundings .The location , very close to the Bridge , was wonderful and made for lovely of the .Breakfast was more than we , with plentiful and a sophisticated atmosphere .The best feature of this hotel was the wonderful and attentive staff .They were very and helpful at all times .They made our stay a wonderful experience . We the contemporary mixed with old world at this lovely property so close to Piazza and Pantheon .Breakfast room was beautifully lit and comfortably large .The breakfast was great too !Only downside is that curtain door to bath does not afford enough privacy if you are traveling with an older child .Ask for a room that the new .We would certainly stay here again . We our stay at The River Hotel .It is a great location easily accessible to public transit .Our room was small , but it had a type of feel , and it many were .We had both a small and a microwave which was helpful .The free wireless is a nice feature with ability to print downstairs .I did not use the fitness center since we do so much walking , but would have had they had a pool .My bad for not that .The water bottle filling on each floor is also another great feature .We did not eat at the restaurant , but there are many nearby , \\' and for coffee and breakfast .of 3 was taking place during our visit which made it very interesting . We just got back from and we stayed two nights at this location .It was perfect .Close to station ( 10 min .walk ) and Time square ( 10 min .walk ).It was clean .The room are very big , the only problem was that the sofa bed was not comfortable at all .It would be time to have their mattress to be change .Don \\' t expect to get a nice room cause it \\' s very old fashion .The only problem was we \\' t have . My experience with my reservation which I made via the phone ; the reservationist me to use a web rate which was accommodating .I 3 before check - in to find out that my room was ready .( From a petite to a Queen Luxe .)Room size was fine , especially for .The bathroom was a treat .Lots of , but not tacky .Only complaint was that the lighting could have been better for make - up application .Excellent bath ; shampoo & conditioner and and lotion .Shower was fabulous .Bed was very comfortable .station / clock \\' t work , but that was within 5 ./ library is a nice feature , but not a great selection and almost everything I was out of stock ; it like they did not have .The best part of my stay was the service .I was by every staff member I .I work in a hotel in guest , so I \\' m very picky about this aspect of my stay .Everything I or for was taken care of promptly .Entire feel of the hotel was intimate and cozy and a nice respite from the pace of .Great Location too ! I know well and this one is an excellent choice if you are looking for a step up from a budget hotel but still want something reasonable .The are very comfortable , clean and the bath is exceptionally nice .The - comes in handy when you want to buy cheese !The staff is very helpful .Breakfast is as one would expect -- juice , bread , , cereal and .The location is ideal .The bus stop is around the corner and the stop is a block or two away .You can easily walk to Dame and stroll through the Quarter .Yet , you are in a neighborhood and you can get a glimpse into life .The cheese store is typical and fabulous . Just returned today from a 4 night stay in at the Four .The service is typical Four , always there when you need them , with few .The only complaint is the shower water pressure .I felt it was low , but my partner thought it was perfect .The bathroom is huge , with one of the I \\' ever seen in a hotel .The bathroom mirror a television built into it .Great idea !are on in every room .The view of Sound was perfect .The front desk staff me by name every time I the desk , and always with a smile .The business center was spotlessly clean , and new and .We did not eat at ART , but would like to next time .The hotel location could not have been better . We were 2 taking an early flight out of in . 2011 .We booked 2 , 1 on their program which us to park our car for 2 .The hotel great , plenty of food for breakfast , and an efficient shuttle to the airport .Upon our return , the shuttle driver picked us up and drove us right to our car to unload our luggage .We will happily do this again rather than dealing with a hotel and different parking facility .And it was , too . We really our stay at the .We went there after ready really good on TA we were not - the service is good and the room as well - thoroughly and the breakfast at the bar is delicious - would recommend ( if you are looking for a laid back good hotel - if you are looking for top of the range 5 *, go somewhere else ) We live in and often visit family in the San Bay Area .We stopped in some 17 ago on our way home from and stayed at the Spa .We so the beautiful grounds and the 3 mineral that we make it a point to visit at least once and sometimes twice a year .The Spa and is our favorite spot in the Wine Country .'"
